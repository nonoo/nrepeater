- LITZ Emergency Alert: LITZ is a new system promoted by the ARRL to provide
  a means for a repeater user to request emergency assistance without being
  familiar with the operation of the repeater. If a repeater user transmits
  a DTMF [0] for three seconds, nrepeater will alert the control operators.
